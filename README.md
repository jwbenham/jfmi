#jfmi

Java File Meta-Information application - allows the user to associate files with
tags and comments.


## Building

### Building the Project Source Classes

Running `make all` in the top-level directory will build the project source files.

### Building the Project Unit Tests

Running `make tests` in the top-level directory will build the project JUnit
test classes.


## Running

### Running the JFMI Application

The "jfmi/control/JFMIMain" class contains the `main()` method for starting the
application. The "run.sh" shell script will pass JFMIMain to the java launcher
and set the classpath to the appropriate value.

### Running Unit Tests

The "runtest.sh" shell script located in the top-level project directory is
a convenience script for running unit tests.

Example:
Say we have a class located at src/jfmi/util/StringUtil.class, and that we have
written a JUnit test for it in src/tests/jfmi/util/StringUtilTest.class. The JUnit
test can be started with the following command:
`./runtest.sh util.StringUtilTest`


## Documentation

Documentation associated with JFMI is contained in the 'docs/' directory. This
included javadoc documentation as well as other information - e.g. the SQL
statements used to build the application's database tables.

### Java Class Documentation

Javadoc documentation can be generated by running `make jdoc`. It can be
removed by running `make cleandoc`.
